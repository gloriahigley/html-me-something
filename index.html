                        <p class="intro"> Hello, and welcome to my website. My name is Gloria Higley and I am an aspiring software developer. I am currently a Knowledge Manager with a large financial technology company in Kansas City, MO. I love my job and am learning to code to enhance my skillset for my current role and eventually plan to transition to a more technical job. When I'm not learning to code you can find me at the lake with my husband, Andrew and our daughter, Fiona.</p>

                <h1>Learning to Code</h1>
                    <a name="Learn"></a>
                    <p>I graduated from college with undergraduate and graduate degrees in general business management. I never really knew what I wanted to be when I grew up so I went where I was led in regards to my education. Once I had been in the workforce for a few years, I realized that I had a natural affinity and preference for working with systems and technology. A mentor of mine suggested that I look into learning to program as a possible career option and development opportunity. <br><br>
                            
                            To get started learning to code, I began looking at free resources to learn introductory HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provided by awesome websites like <a href="www.codeacademy.com">Code Academy</a> and <a href="www.freecodecamp.com">freeCodeCamp</a>. I was instantly hooked but also struggled a lot with applying the concepts to real projects that I learned in the tutorials. I had always learned in a traditional classroom setting and but I did not want to go back to school again. Having been in college already for so many years of my life, I really wanted to take a different path to gaining new skills. 
                            
                            Once I got past the initial introductory courses online, I had no idea where to go from there and was completely overwhelmed by the magnitude of everything I thought I may need to know. I realized that I needed to emulate my traditional learning experience by finding a way to have access to instructors and a curriculum to guide my learning. <br></br> To facilitate that I began to apply to free or reduced cost coding workshops in Kansas City. (Off topic but too important not to mention: the support in Kansas City for learning to code in <strong>phenomenal</strong>, especially for those under-represented in tech.) Participation in workshops ultimately led me to learning about LaunchCode 101 and applying to be part of the class. I did not make the cut the first year I applied but did make it in for the Fall 2017 class and am currently enrolled. It has been such an awesome experience so far and exactly the catalyst I needed to get me to the next step in my education. </p>
